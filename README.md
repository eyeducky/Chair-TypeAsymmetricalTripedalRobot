## Installation
- ROS

You need to have ROS installed on your system. If you haven't installed ROS yet, follow the steps below:
1. Visit the official ROS website: http://www.ros.org/
2. Choose the appropriate ROS distribution for your operating system (e.g., Melodic, Noetic).
3. Follow the installation instructions provided on the ROS website for your specific OS.


-edit-

If you using ROS Noetic, you need to change '#!/usr/bin/env python' to '#!/usr/bin/env python3' in the python files


And also install the following
```shell
sudo apt-get install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-rosserial-arduino
sudo apt-get install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-rosserial
```

- Python
```shell
pip install rospkg
pip install numpy
pip install onnxruntime
```
## Usage
- Run the launch file:
```shell
cd launch
roslaunch drive.launch
```

- Execute the pose planning program in a separate terminal:
```shell
cd src
./rl_walk.py # or any other relevant program (e.g., connect_walk.py, connect_walk.py, rl_walk.py, rl_stand.py, rl_walk_and_stand.py)
```

## Description
- `embedded`: Programs to be flashed onto Arduino Nano Every.
- `launch`: ROS launch files.
- `mjcf`: MuJoCo XML File and STL files.
- `models`: Pre-trained models saved in ONNX format.
- `src`: Gate Generating programs, including five types  
connect_walk.py, connect_walk.py, rl_walk.py, rl_stand.py, rl_walk_and_stand.py.
